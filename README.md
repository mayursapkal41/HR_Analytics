Mini Guide: Project Steps & How to Run1. Perform EDA on HR DataLocation: eda.ipynbInitial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and uncover potential drivers of attrition. The eda.ipynb notebook includes visualizations and statistical summaries to analyze:Department-wise Attrition: Attrition rates across different departments.Salary Bands: Relationship between MonthlyIncome and attrition.Promotions: Impact of YearsSinceLastPromotion on attrition.Other Relevant Factors: Detailed analysis of JobRole, OverTime, MaritalStatus, Age, JobSatisfaction, EnvironmentSatisfaction, RelationshipSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, JobInvolvement, and various tenure-related fields (YearsAtCompany, YearsInCurrentRole, YearsSinceLastPromotion, YearsWithCurrManager).To view EDA: Open eda.ipynb in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, VS Code with Jupyter extension).2. Build a Classification Model (Decision Tree)Location: classification_model.ipynbA Decision Tree Classifier was implemented to predict employee attrition. The key steps and results from classification_model.ipynb are:Data Preprocessing: Categorical variables were encoded using pd.get_dummies, and irrelevant columns (EmployeeNumber, EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours) were dropped. The Attrition column was mapped to numerical values (Yes: 1, No: 0).Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets (70% train, 30% test) with stratify=y to maintain the class distribution.Model Training: A DecisionTreeClassifier with random_state=42 and max_depth=5 was trained on the X_train and y_train data.Prediction: The trained model made predictions on the X_test set.Model Performance & Evaluation:The classification_model.ipynb outputs the following performance metrics:Confusion Matrix:[[339  31]
 [ 53  18]]
This indicates:339 correct predictions for 'No' attrition (True Negatives).18 correct predictions for 'Yes' attrition (True Positives).31 incorrect predictions (False Positives - predicted 'Yes' but was 'No').53 incorrect predictions (False Negatives - predicted 'No' but was 'Yes').Classification Report:              precision    recall  f1-score   support

Visualize Attrition Factors using Power BILocation: HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbixAn interactive and visually comprehensive Power BI dashboard has been designed to effectively communicate insights into employee attrition. This dashboard leverages the cleaned data and insights from the EDA to highlight key attrition drivers. It includes visuals such as:Overall Employee Attrition RateAttrition by DepartmentAttrition by Job RoleAttrition by Marital StatusImpact of Overtime on AttritionAttrition by Age GroupAverage Monthly Income of Attrited vs. Non-Attrited EmployeesEmployee Tenure vs. Attrition StatusInteractive Slicers for various dimensions.Power BI Dashboard Overview:(Replace images/powerbi_dashboard_overview.png with the actual link to your hosted Power BI dashboard screenshot on GitHub.)To view the Power BI Dashboard:Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your system.Open the HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix file directly using Power BI Desktop.4. Perform SHAP Value AnalysisLocation: classification_model.ipynbSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were computed to interpret the predictions of the Decision Tree model. This technique provides transparency by:Identifying Feature Importance: Determining which features contribute most significantly to the model's overall output.Explaining Individual Predictions: Showing how each feature's value pushes the prediction for a specific employee higher or lower.Understanding Feature Impact: Revealing the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of each feature's influence on the attrition prediction.The classification_model.ipynb notebook includes the code to calculate SHAP values and is designed to save a shap_attrition_long.csv file, which is suitable for Power BI visualization. To generate this file, ensure the relevant cell in the classification_model.ipynb notebook is executed.SHAP Summary Plot (Feature Importance):(Replace images/shap_summary_plot.png with the actual link to your hosted SHAP summary plot screenshot from your notebook or Power BI on GitHub.)To view SHAP Analysis: The SHAP analysis code and instructions for preparing the data for Power BI are integrated into the classification_model.ipynb notebook.Key Findings and Insights(This section should be populated with specific findings once your Power BI dashboard is complete and you've analyzed the SHAP outputs. Based on the provided notebook outputs, here are some initial points you can expand upon):Overall Accuracy: The Decision Tree model achieves an overall accuracy of 81%. However, the classification report reveals a significant imbalance in predicting 'Yes' (attrition), leading to lower precision (0.37) and recall (0.25) for this class.Strong Performance for Non-Attrition (Class 0): The model performs much better for predicting 'No' attrition ('0'), with high precision (0.86) and recall (0.92).Top Attrition Drivers (from SHAP/EDA - to be detailed after Power BI visualization): Expect to highlight features like Overtime, Monthly Income, Years at Company, and Job Satisfaction as significant indicators of attrition, as confirmed by your visualizations.Attrition Prevention SuggestionsBased on the comprehensive insights derived from the EDA, Power BI dashboard, and SHAP analysis, a set of actionable recommendations to mitigate employee attrition has been compiled. These suggestions are detailed in the Attrition_Prevention_Suggestions.pdf document and aim to address the identified root causes of employee turnover.Future EnhancementsModel Improvement: Focus on improving the model's performance for the minority class ('Yes' attrition) using resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) or ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and hyperparameter tuning.Advanced SHAP Visualizations in Power BI: Incorporate the shap_attrition_long.csv data into Power BI to create interactive SHAP plots, allowing users to explore feature impacts more dynamically.What-If Analysis: Develop a simple tool (e.g., in Python or a Power BI parameter) to allow users to see how changing certain employee characteristics might affect their predicted attrition risk.Time-Series Analysis: If historical attrition data is available, perform time-series analysis to identify trends and seasonality in attrition.
